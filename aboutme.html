<p title="Example">Most of the functions and the way that you can make an object move are the same. Python is like scratch but has a different wording of some of the blocks we used.</p>
<p>Since I'm new to python and my partners already had most of the project done, I mostly had to deal with understanding python. It was hard at first but, after i got it, it was fun seeing what we could add to our porgram.<p/>
<p>A list is a collection of data points that starts counting at 0.</p>
<p>I worked with Fareeha and it was fun. We finished early and worked on creating different filters.</p>
<p>I enjoyed figuring out how to create the blue tint filter with my partner. We used the loops to change each pixel, variables for the intensity, functions to change the color, and conditions to also change the color.</p>
<p>Today we worked on circuits and we had issues with our LED. Our circuits wouldn't work because some of the LEDs were not working properly. I learned how to use the BOE shield.</p>

<p>Both Manuela Veloso and Ayanna Howard worked with artificial intelligence and robotics. We worked pretty well on the lightshow. We could have been a little more patient. Other groups used more for loops. The basic pieces of every Arduino sketch are the void setup and the void loop.</p>
<p>I learned how to send a coded signal to my robot and how similar it is to the circuits I made in physics. My favorite part was the turn. They would need motion sensors and specific actions for it to perform.</p>
