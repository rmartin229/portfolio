<p title="Example">Most of the functions and the way that you can make an object move are the same. Python is like scratch but has a different wording of some of the blocks we used.</p>
<p>Since I'm new to python and my partners already had most of the project done, I mostly had to deal with understanding python. It was hard at first but, after i got it, it was fun seeing what we could add to our porgram.<p/>
