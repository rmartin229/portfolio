<p title="Example">Most of the functions and the way that you can make an object move are the same. Python is like scratch but has a different wording of some of the blocks we used.</p>
<p>Since I'm new to python and my partners already had most of the project done, I mostly had to deal with understanding python. It was hard at first but, after i got it, it was fun seeing what we could add to our porgram.<p/>

  <p>I worked with Fareeha and it was fun. We finished early and worked on creating different filters.</p>
  <p>I enjoyed figuring out how to create the blue tint filter with my partner. We used the loops to change each pixel, variables for the intensity, functions to change the color, and conditions to also change the color.</p>
